    You can read more about that here: https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html
    This logic can live in this spot in any component you write! 
    You can also extract it to functions in a separate file if you prefer, then import them with `import myFunc from "./myFunc"`
    Read more about imports here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
    You can even create custom hooks - which you can learn about here: https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks
